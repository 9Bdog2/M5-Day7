CORS (cross-origin resourse sharing )

CORS is a very used middleware to mae our API available only for our frontend 

Take the application to the cloud allows us to make it available to the general public 

.env(enviorment) - in the root of the project

PORT = 3001

.gitignore // .env added to not upload on the repository

DB_CONNECTION_STRING, 3RD_PARTY_TOKEN 

npm i -D dotenv - install the package

"dev" : "nodemon -e js -r dotenv/config./src/server.js"

const port = process.env.PORT

logs are really important
